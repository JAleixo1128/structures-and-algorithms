# Animals Simulation
A lightweight C++ simulation demonstrating inheritance, dynamic polymorphism, and object-oriented design.

## Overview
This project implements several animal types (Bird, Hamster, Snake, etc.) that inherit from a base `Animal` class.  
Each animal supports behaviors such as eating, drinking, printing status, and updating hunger/thirst levels.

## Build
```bash
g++ src/*.cpp -I include -o animals
