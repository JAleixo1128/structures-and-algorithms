Variables
mode: Integer
Specifies the collision resolution strategy:
0: Linear Probing
1: Double Hashing
2: Separate Chaining
table: Vector of integers
Stores hash table values for Linear Probing and Double Hashing.
chain_table: Vector of lists
Stores hash table values for Separate Chaining.
table_size: Integer
Current size of the hash table.
num_elements: Integer
Tracks the total number of elements in the table.
num_collisions: Integer
Counts the total number of collisions during insertion.
Functions
Constructor
Type: Initialization
Purpose: Initialize the hash table with a size of 16 and set variables (table, chain_table, num_elements, num_collisions) based on the selected mode.
resize_table()
Type: Private Function
Purpose: Double the size of the table when the load factor (number of elements ÷ table size) exceeds 70%. Rehash all existing elements into the new table.
h1(key)
Type: Helper Function
Purpose: Calculate the primary hash value (key % table_size).
h2(key)
Type: Helper Function
Purpose: Calculate the secondary hash value for Double Hashing (key^2 % TABLE_PRIME).
insert(key)
Type: Public Function
Purpose: Insert a key into the hash table based on the mode:
Linear Probing: Check the next available slot.
Double Hashing: Use a secondary hash to resolve collisions.
Separate Chaining: Append the key to a list at the hash index.
Increment num_collisions for every collision during insertion.
print_table()
Type: Public Function
Purpose: Print the current state of the hash table. For Separate Chaining, display all keys in each list.
get_num_collisions()
Type: Public Function
Purpose: Return the total number of collisions encountered so far.
Steps of Execution
Initialize Hash Table
Create the hash table based on the mode and initialize variables.
Insert Values
Read values from the input file and insert them into the hash table.
Resize if Necessary
Before each insertion, check if the table exceeds 70% capacity. If so, resize and rehash.
Track Collisions
During insertion, count the collisions caused by hash function conflicts.
Print the Hash Table
Display the table’s current state and the total number of collisions.
