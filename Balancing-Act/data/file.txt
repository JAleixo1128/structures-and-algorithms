Variables:
data: An integer value stored in each node (e.g., 5, 10). This is the value of the node in the tree.
left: A pointer/reference to the left child of the node. It connects to smaller values.
right: A pointer/reference to the right child of the node. It connects to larger values.
color: A true/false value (Boolean) indicating the color of the node. Red (true) means the node is new, and Black (false) indicates stability.
Components:
1. Node Class (LLRBTNode):
Purpose: Represents a single unit in the tree.
What it does: Stores the node's value, left and right connections, and its color (red or black).
2. Tree Class (LLRBTree):
Purpose: Manages the entire tree and its operations (inserting, balancing, traversing).
What it does: Starts with an empty tree and allows nodes to be added while keeping the tree balanced.
Functions:
Insert Function:
Purpose: Adds a new value into the tree.
How it works:
Finds the correct position for the new value.
Adds it as a red (temporary) node.
Fixes the tree if it becomes unbalanced.
Balancing Functions:
Rotate Left:
Purpose: Fixes situations where the right child is red and causes imbalance.
How it works: Makes the right child the parent and adjusts the tree connections.
Rotate Right:
Purpose: Fixes situations where the left child and its left child are red.
How it works: Makes the left child the parent and adjusts the tree connections.
Flip Colors:
Purpose: Fixes cases where both children are red.
How it works: Changes the current node to red and its children to black.
Balance:
Purpose: Ensures the tree is balanced after every insertion.
How it works: Uses Rotate Left, Rotate Right, and Flip Colors based on node relationships.
Traversal Functions:
Preorder:
Purpose: Prints the nodes starting from the current one, then moves left, then right.
Use: Helps understand the structure of the tree from top to bottom.
Inorder:
Purpose: Prints nodes from smallest to largest by visiting the left child, then current node, then right child.
Use: Verifies the tree is sorted correctly.
Postorder:
Purpose: Visits the left child, then the right child, then the current node.
Use: Useful for deleting or analyzing subtrees.
Height Function:
Purpose: Measures the distance from the current node to the farthest leaf node.
How it works:
Recursively checks the height of the left and right subtrees.
Returns the larger value + 1.
